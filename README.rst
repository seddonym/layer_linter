Layer Linter checks that your project follows a custom-defined layered architecture, based on
its internal dependencies (i.e. the imports between its modules).

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://layer-linter.readthedocs.io.

**Warning:** This software is currently in beta. This means there may be changes that break backward
compatibility. However, due to it being a development tool (rather than something that needs to be installed
on a production system), it should be suitable for inclusion in your testing pipeline. It also means we actively
encourage people to try it out and `submit bug reports`_.

Overview
--------

Layer Linter is a command line tool to check that you are following a self-imposed
architecture within your Python project. It does this by analysing the internal
imports between all the modules in your code base, and compares this
against a set of simple rules that you provide in a ``layers.yml`` file.

For example, you can use it to check that no modules inside ``myproject.foo``
import from any modules inside ``myproject.bar``, even indirectly.

This is particularly useful if you are working on a complex codebase within a team,
when you want to enforce a particular architectural style. In this case you can add
Layer Linter to your deployment pipeline, so that any code that does not follow
the architecture will fail tests.

Quick start
-----------

Install Layer Linter::

    pip install layer-linter

Decide on the dependency flows you wish to check. In this example, we have
organised our project into three subpackages, ``myproject.high``, ``myproject.medium``
and ``myproject.low``. These subpackages are known as *layers*. Note: layers must
have the same parent package (i.e. all be in the same directory). This parent is known as a *container*.

Create a ``layers.yml`` in the root of your project. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    My Layers Contract:
      containers:
        - myproject
      layers:
        - high
        - medium
        - low

(This contract tells Layer Linter that the order of the layers runs from ``low`` at the bottom
to ``high`` at the top. Layers higher up can import ones lower down, but not the other way around.)

Note that the container is an absolute name of a Python package, while the layers are relative to the container.

Now, from your project root, run::

    layer-lint myproject

If your code violates the contract, you will see an error message something like this:

.. code-block:: none
