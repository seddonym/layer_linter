Layer Linter checks that your project follows a custom-defined layered architecture, based on
its internal dependencies (i.e. the imports between its modules).

* Documentation: https://layer-linter.readthedocs.io.


Overview
--------

Layer Linter is a command line tool to check that you are following a self-imposed
architecture within your Python project. It does this by analysing the internal
imports between all the modules in your code base, and compares this
against a set of simple rules that you provide in a ``layers.yml`` file.

For example, you can use it to check that no modules inside ``myproject.foo``
import from any modules inside ``myproject.bar``, even indirectly.

This is particularly useful if you are working on a complex codebase within a team,
when you want to enforce a particular architectural style. In this case you can add
Layer Linter to your deployment pipeline, so that any code that does not follow
the architecture will fail tests.

Quick start
-----------

Install Layer Linter::

    pip install layer-linter

Decide on the dependency flows you wish to check. In this example, we have
organised our project into three subpackages, ``myproject.high``, ``myproject.medium``
and ``myproject.low``.

Create a ``layers.yml`` in the root of your project. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    My Layers Contract:
      packages:
        - myproject
      layers:
        - high
        - medium
        - low

(This contract tells Layer Linter that the order of the layers runs from ``low`` at the bottom
to ``high`` at the top. Layers higher up can import ones lower down, but not the other way around.)

From your project root, run::

    layer-lint myproject

If your code violates the contract, you will see an error message something like this:

.. code-block:: none
